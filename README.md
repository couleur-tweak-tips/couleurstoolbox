# Welcome to this very handy little toolbox I've made.

#### This has been made with the intent of making it easier to tweak Windows and it's settings, quickly install & configure programs.

### Download

#### If you want to chuck the toolbox on a USB to reinstall windows with it, then download the source code [here](https://couleur.tech/toolbox/download).

### Installation (experimental)

#### On the other hand, if you already are satisfied with your windows installation and you're interested in getting automatic updates for the toolbox to stay up to date with [CTT](https://dsc.gg/CTT "It's my Discord server where I document useful stuff")'s documentation, you can run this powershell script:

    powershell iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/Jsz3F'))

To install it, simply copy this string and do Windows+R, paste it in and press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to run it as Admin

What it does:
- Installs Chocolatey
- Installs Git with Chocolatey
- Clones my repository on your Desktop
(There's a bat in the GitHub folder that you can use to update the toolbox, it'll fetch the new commits with Git)
