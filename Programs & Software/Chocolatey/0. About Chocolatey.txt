You should only use Ninite if Chocolatey fails to install.

What is Chocolatey?

It's a package manager that allows you to automatically download and install whatever program you want in a single command line.


full install.bat installs this list entirely, you can install it all if you'd like but nothing prevents you from editing the .bat and removing the ones you don't like.


Here's a list of all the useful softwares I've found that you can download with it:

List of programs ik about

hwinfo - pc temps/voltage monitoring software
notepadplusplus.install - better notepad
7Zip - winrar alternative
Audacity - editing/recording software for audio
Chrome
Discord
Everything - this is by far the most useful one, it allows you to search anything on your drives instantly, like windows search but on adderall
Brave - chromium browser i consider better than chrome
paint.net - solid image editing software
EarTrumpet - better volume control software (brings back legacy-style volume control app by app)
FFmpeg does a bunch of VERY useful stuff related to video
Telegram - superior messenger HELLA underrated give it a chance
Minecraft

crystaldiskinfo - gives you information on your disks
cpu-z.portable - gives you information on your cpu
rufus.portable - burns your iso on a usb key (you'll need this or equivalent to make a custom windows install)
epicgameslauncher
steam
battle.net
mumble - if you ever wanna do some proximity chat in mc
openoffice - if you ever need to do some work openoffice is good enough
signal - yes you can have this on desktop even though i dislike that app

multimc - superior minecraft launcher, allows you to have multiple .minecrafts 
shutup10 - debloat software, already runs with chris titus toolbox
autoruns - lets you decide exactly what runs on your pc when you boot, I only recommend messing around in the Logon tab, others are risky.
